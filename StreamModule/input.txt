The Sustainable Development Goals Fund
 (SDG Fund) is an international multi-donor 
 and multi-agency development mechanism created 
 in 2014 by the United Nations to support sustainable 
 development activities through integrated and multidimensional 
 joint programmes.

The SDG Fund is the first 
UN development cooperation mechanism 
specifically established to implement the 2030 Agenda.
